---First opening---
Index and split files into 1000 entries
After initial Indexation create a file with number of files (to compare)

---Consecutive openings---
Check if file number checker has the same value, with the number of files currently present in the dir
	If the number is the same progress to the app and load stuff
	If the number is different ask the user to reindex (Yes/No) and delete all the files in directory before reindexing
